## I wanna build a website what do i need to learn ?

To build a website from sratch you don't need to have any special knowledge or education.
You can simply go ahead start learning.

It provides syntax coloring and auto complete.

We shouldn't stress about time, everyone should learn it their own pace.

## Is there any shortcuts that can make coding a webpage easier ?

Yes when working with a lot of code we can come accross pieces of code that get repeated a lot so we package it in what is called library.
Those library can do common tasks. Developers are kind enough to share these libraries for free.
