# Build a website with just HTML

In this therapy, Amal builds her own website with just HTML.
We'll be using visual studio code as the main editor along with the live server extension to have auto refresh whenever we change something in the website and save.

### Downloading visual studio code

Download visual studio code, it's an opensource and free code editor by Microsoft. You use this [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Writing your first HTML file

Every website is a folder with a files in it. The first entry point is usually called index.html.

- Create a Folder called `website` or call it anything you want.

- Create a another html page called page1.html and repeat the previous steps

### Link between html pages

- Use the `<a>` element to define a link.
- Use the `href` attribute to define the link address.
