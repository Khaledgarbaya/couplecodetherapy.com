# How to style navigations and center containers in CSS

Hey Friends!

This is exciting, In Couple Code Therapy Episode Six

My Lovely partner continues using CSS to improve her website look and feel, We'll cover how to style text in detail

## Show Notes

We'll cover :

- Mastering text styling with CSS. 
- We'll go through all the basic fundamentals of text/font styling in detail, like setting font weight, family and style, text alignment, and other effects, and line and letter spacing.

The CSS properties used to style text generally fall into two categories, which we'll look at separately in this article:

- *Font styles*: Properties that affect the font that is applied to the text, affecting what font is applied, how big it is, whether it is bold, italic, etc.

- *Text layout styles*: Properties that affect the spacing and other layout features of the text, allowing manipulation of, for example, the space between lines and letters, and how the text is aligned within the content box.
